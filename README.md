I used pointers in this assignment in order to access the values initialized in the main function in other functions through the program. Using nullPtr was also useful to check if dereferencing a pointer would actually lead me to a value. 

By using const in certain function parameters I made sure that the value being passed would not be changed even if I accidentally tried to.

A reference is used when adding a student so that the size variable can be changed directly from the addStudent function.

Static cast was used to change the double to an int safely. 

When attempting to add students past capacity or calculating the average GPA for zero students I throw a string exception.

The control flow of the program is based off of a do-while loop with a command line menu. A switch with different cases calls functions to perform changes.
